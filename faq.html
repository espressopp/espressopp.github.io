<h1>Frequently Asked Questions<a class="headerlink" href="#frequently-asked-questions" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h1>
<p class="rubric">Do I need to learn Python when using ESPResSo++?</p>
<p>The short answer is &#8220;no&#8221;. Most of the example scripts are
self-explanatory and can be adapted for your purposes by simple
changes. You can also use ESPResSo++ like other MD simulation software,
that is driven by some kind of configuration file.</p>
<p>The long answer is &#8220;yes&#8221;. If you want to take advantage of all
features of ESPResSo++ you need some knowledge of how the
Python interpreter works.</p>
<p>But don&#8217;t be afraid of learning Python:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Python is easy to learn</li>
<li>The ESPResSo++ example simulation scripts gives you a very fast
insight of how Python works.</li>
<li>Writing programs in Python is much easier than writing programs in C++</li>
<li>Python programs are easier to read than Tcl or Perl programs.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>And here are some arguments why it is worth while:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>There are many Python programs you can use in your applications</li>
<li>Python gives you a flexible way of running MD simulations with ESPResSo++</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p class="rubric">Do you support other script languages, e.g. Tcl/Tk?</p>
<p>No.  We choose the support only Python as ESPResSo++ scripting language.
This enables ESPResSo++ users to read and adapt scripts written by other
ESPResSo++ users.</p>
<p class="rubric">Can Tcl scripts converted to Python automatically?</p>
<p>The recommendation is - don&#8217;t do it!  Instead, a Tcl interpreter can
be loaded via Python and given the job to do. That is similar to what
Tkinter does; Tkinter is a wrapper to use the Tk toolkit from Python.</p>
<p class="rubric">Why should I use Python if C++ programs are much faster?</p>
<p>Python is the driver of your simulation which will still run in the
ESPResSo++ C++ engine.</p>
<p>Python programs are about 30 to 50 times slower than the same programs
written in C++.</p>
<p>That is why we use Python to set up and control simulations while the
simulation system itself is written in efficient C++ code.</p>
<p class="rubric">Can I run ESPResSo++ on parallel machines?</p>
<p>Yes. The parallel version uses MPI and is therefore as portable as MPI is.
Typical MD simulations scale rather well.</p>
<p class="rubric">Do I need to write parallel scripts for parallel machines?</p>
<p>No. The Python scripts are executed only by the first processor which
will broadcast the ESPResSo++ commands to the other processors
automatically using the PMI interface (Parallel Method
Invocation). For you, it will look like a serial script. But the particles
of the simulation are distributed among the available processors and
the commands issued for ESPResSo++ will be executed by each processor.</p>
<p class="rubric">How efficient is ESPResSo++?</p>
<p>Efficiency is a high priority though less than the extendability of the system. You
should expect a good performance but might be that ESPResSo++ is less efficient than other
simulation programs that are around.</p>
<p>If you experience that ESPResSo++ is more than 2 times slower than other simulation systems
you have found a performance bug.</p>
<p class="rubric">Do I need the source code distribution or can I use binary version?</p>
<p>Currently, we only provide a source code distribution. This might
change in the future.  Our major problem to provide binary versions is
that there are many different Python versions and the binary versions
of the ESPResSo++ and python libraries must not be of mixed versions.</p>
<p class="rubric">Which build systems are used for ESPResSo++?</p>
<p>Compilation and installation of ESPResSo++ is due to the many shared
libraries and loadable modules rather complex and so we use a build
system to make our job and maintainability easier.</p>
<p>Currently we support building the system with cmake.</p>
<p class="rubric">What means extendability?</p>
<p>Each software is in a certain sense extendable by adding some
functionality somewhere in the code. But we understand extendability
in the following sense:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>You can add functionality without changing existent interfaces. For the object-oriented
approach this means in practice: take an available base class and define a new derived
class with your needed functionality.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
